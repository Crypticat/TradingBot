## 1. Introduction / Overview

* **Purpose:** Briefly describe the web application, its core function, and the value it provides to users or the business. What problem does this UI solve?
* **Context:** Explain the background. Is this a new application, a feature enhancement, or a redesign? What triggers this project?
* **Scope:** Clearly define what is included in *this specific* version or release covered by this PRD. What are the boundaries?

*Example:*
> This document outlines the requirements for the initial launch (v1.0) of the "Project Dashboard" web UI. This application will provide internal teams with a centralized view of ongoing project statuses, key deadlines, and resource allocation. It aims to replace manual tracking via spreadsheets, improving visibility and efficiency. The scope for v1.0 includes core dashboard viewing, user login, and basic project filtering.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

* List the primary goals for this web UI project. Use the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) framework.
* Connect these goals to larger business objectives if applicable.

*Example:*
> * Reduce time spent by managers compiling project status reports by 50% within 3 months of launch.
> * Increase on-time project completion rate by 10% within 6 months, attributed to better visibility.
> * Achieve a user satisfaction score of >80% based on an in-app survey conducted 1 month post-launch.
> * Ensure 90% of users can find a specific project's status within 60 seconds.

## 3. User Personas / Target Audience

* Describe the intended users of this web UI.
* Include details like their role, technical skills, primary goals when using the app, and any relevant pain points the UI aims to address.
* Link to more detailed persona documents if they exist separately.

*Example:*
> * **Alex (Project Manager):** Tech-savvy, needs a quick overview of all their projects, deadlines, and potential blockers. Currently spends hours consolidating data. Needs reliable, real-time information. Uses primarily desktop.
> * **Sam (Team Lead):** Moderate tech skills, needs to see tasks assigned to their team members across projects. Needs simple filtering and clear status indicators. Uses desktop and occasionally tablet.
> * **Chloe (Executive):** Low tech interaction, needs high-level summaries and overall portfolio health view. Needs clear visuals and export options. Uses desktop and mobile.

## 4. Functional Requirements

* Detail *what* the web UI application must *do*. This is the core of the PRD.
* Use User Stories (preferred): "As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [I can achieve a goal]."
* Assign unique IDs (e.g., FR-001) for traceability.
* Group requirements by feature or logical component. Be specific about UI elements and interactions.

*Example:*
> **4.1 User Authentication**
> * **FR-001:** As a user, I want to log in using my company email and password via an SSO provider (e.g., Okta) so that I can access the dashboard securely.
> * **FR-002:** As a user, I want to see an error message if my login attempt fails, indicating the likely reason (e.g., "Invalid credentials").
> * **FR-003:** As a logged-in user, I want a clearly visible "Logout" button so that I can end my session securely.
>
> **4.2 Dashboard View**
> * **FR-004:** As a Project Manager, I want to see a list of all projects assigned to me on the main dashboard view.
> * **FR-005:** As a user, I want the project list to display the Project Name, Current Status (e.g., On Track, At Risk, Delayed), Key Deadline, and Project Lead.
> * **FR-006:** As a user, I want to be able to filter the project list by Status.
> * **FR-007:** As a user, I want to click on a project name in the list to navigate to a detailed view (details TBD in a separate section/PRD).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

* Define the qualities, constraints, and standards the application must meet. How *well* should it work?

*Example:*
> **5.1 Performance**
> * **NFR-001:** The dashboard page must load completely within 3 seconds on a standard corporate network connection.
> * **NFR-002:** Filtering the project list must update the UI within 500ms.
> * **NFR-003:** The UI must provide visual feedback (e.g., spinners, skeleton loaders) during data loading or processing that takes longer than 200ms.
>
> **5.2 Usability & Accessibility**
> * **NFR-004:** The application must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility guidelines.
> * **NFR-005:** All interactive elements must have clear hover and focus states.
> * **NFR-006:** The UI must be responsive and usable across common screen resolutions for desktop (e.g., 1280px+ width), tablet (e.g., 768px+ width), and mobile (e.g., 360px+ width).
>
> **5.3 Security**
> * **NFR-007:** All communication between the browser and server must use HTTPS.
> * **NFR-008:** Input fields must be validated on both client and server sides to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS).
> * **NFR-009:** User sessions must time out after [e.g., 30 minutes] of inactivity.
>
> **5.4 Compatibility (Browsers/Devices)**
> * **NFR-010:** Support the latest two stable versions of: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari.
> * **NFR-011:** Ensure core functionality works on the latest versions of iOS and Android mobile operating systems.
>
> **5.5 Maintainability & Scalability**
> * **NFR-012:** Frontend code must adhere to the team's established coding standards and style guide [Link to standards doc].
> * **NFR-013:** The architecture should allow for adding new project metadata fields in the future with minimal refactoring.

## 6. Design & User Experience (UX)

* Reference the design artifacts. **Do not** replicate detailed designs here; link to the source of truth.
* Summarize key interaction principles if necessary.

*Example:*
> **6.1 Wireframes & Mockups**
> * Low-fidelity wireframes illustrating layout and basic flow: [Link to Wireframes on Miro/Figma/etc.]
> * High-fidelity mockups showing the final visual design, components, and states: [Link to Mockups on Figma/Sketch/Zeplin/etc.]
>
> **6.2 Key User Flows**
> * Detailed user flow diagrams for critical tasks (e.g., Login, Filtering Projects, Navigating to Detail View): [Link to User Flow Diagrams]
>
> **6.3 Style Guide / UI Kit Reference**
> * The application must implement the visual styles and components defined in the official Company Design System: [Link to Design System/UI Kit Documentation]

## 7. Release Criteria

* Define the specific conditions that must be met before the application can be released to users.

*Example:*
> * All Functional Requirements (Section 4) implemented and verified by QA.
> * All P0 and P1 priority bugs resolved. No more than [e.g., 5] P2 bugs outstanding.
> * Successful completion of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with sign-off from key stakeholders.
> * Performance benchmarks (NFR-001, NFR-002) met in the staging environment.
> * Accessibility audit (NFR-004) passed.
> * Security scan passed with no critical or high vulnerabilities found.
> * Required documentation (e.g., user guide draft, release notes) completed.

## 8. Success Metrics

* How will the success of the project (meeting the goals in Section 2) be measured *after* launch?
* What data points need to be tracked?

*Example:*
> * Track page load times and API response times using APM tools (e.g., Datadog, New Relic).
> * Implement analytics tracking (e.g., Google Analytics, Amplitude) for user flows, feature usage (e.g., filter usage), and session duration.
> * Conduct post-launch user surveys focusing on ease of use and satisfaction (link to Goal 3).
> * Monitor error rates and types through logging and monitoring tools.
> * Track adoption rate (e.g., percentage of target users logging in weekly).

## 9. Future Considerations / Out of Scope

* Clearly list features, functionalities, or requirements that are intentionally *not* part of this release.
* Mention potential ideas for future versions to manage expectations.

*Example:*
> **Out of Scope for v1.0:**
> * Project detail view (will be covered in PRD v1.1).
> * Ability to edit project data directly from the dashboard.
> * User role management / Admin interface.
> * Exporting dashboard data to CSV/PDF.
> * Push notifications.
>
> **Future Considerations (Post v1.0):**
> * Adding customizable dashboard widgets.
> * Integration with time-tracking software.
> * Advanced search capabilities.

## 10. Open Issues / Questions

* A place to track questions or decisions that need resolution during the project lifecycle.

*Example:*
