This project has a frontend web UI that is Next.js 14.2.7b and Tailwind. I have installed shadcn ui components. The frontend uses FastAPI to connect to enpoints on the backend. The backend is Python based.

the application frontend is located in ./frontend/tradingbot

Keep dark theme for all Web UI components
Make sure the front end looks beautiful

I prefer bun or bunx to install react modules

This project is to create a trading bot for Luno. The frontend must have an analytics section where one could select and label data points on a graph of crypto prices to train a model. It must also have a way to run existing models from the backend model library. It must also have a produciton section that the model can run as data is pulled on Luno and do actions like buy or sell.

For the backend, use the luno-python library for interacting with luno
